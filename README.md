# Reinforcement-Learning

Implementation of the Q-learning , which is a basic reinforcement learning algorithm for a simple grid-world environment.
This is a simple example using Q-learning, which is a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. 
This example uses a simple environment represented by a 2D grid, and the agent learns to navigate to a goal while avoiding obstacles.

**About Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning paradigm where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. 
The goal of the agent is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

**Key components of reinforcement learning include:**

* Agent: The entity that interacts with the environment and learns to make decisions.
* Environment: The external system with which the agent interacts. The environment provides feedback to the agent in the form of rewards or penalties.
* State: A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment that the agent observes.
* Action: The set of possible moves or decisions that the agent can make in a given state.
* Reward: A numerical value that the agent receives as feedback from the environment, indicating the immediate benefit or cost of an action.

The agent's objective is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. 
Reinforcement learning algorithms can be categorized into model-free and model-based approaches, depending on whether they explicitly model the dynamics of the environment.
Popular algorithms in reinforcement learning include Q-learning, Deep Q Network (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and actor-critic methods

**Here's a breakdown of the code:**

**Environment Setup:**

* 'n_states' and 'n_actions': Define the number of states (locations in the grid) and the number of possible actions (up, down, left, right).
* 'n_episodes': Set the number of episodes for training.

**Initialization:**

* 'Q': Initialize the Q-table with zeros. The Q-table is a matrix where each entry represents the expected future rewards for taking a specific action in a specific state.

**Hyperparameters:**

*'learning_rate': Set the learning rate, which determines how much the Q-values are updated in each iteration.
* 'discount_factor': Set the discount factor, which discounts future rewards to account for the uncertainty of the future.
* 'exploration_prob': Set the exploration probability for epsilon-greedy strategy. This balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

**Reward Matrix:**

* 'R': Define a reward matrix that specifies the rewards and penalties for each state-action pair. In this example, reaching the goal state has a reward of 1, and hitting obstacles has penalties.

**Q-learning Algorithm:**

Iterate over a specified number of episodes ('n_episodes').
For each episode:
* Choose a random initial state.
* While the episode is not done:
* Apply epsilon-greedy exploration to choose an action.
* Observe the next state and the reward for the chosen action.
* Update the Q-value for the current state-action pair using the Bellman equation.
* Move to the next state.
* Check if the episode is done (reached the goal or hit an obstacle).

**Print Q-table:**

* After training, print the learned Q-table, which shows the expected cumulative rewards for each state-action pair.
